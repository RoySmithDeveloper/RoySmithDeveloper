- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoySmithDeveloper.  You can learn more about me by visitng my website www.RoyMSmith.com.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning.  Primarily I am interested in what is commonly referred to as full stack development.  My focus is on vanilla coding as I understand the term.  I have focussed my studies on how to code without using liabraires and frameworks.  With that said, I have exposure to Express for Node.JS and basic exposure to REACT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.JS.  I am always learning JS and new ways to use CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that advances my skills and understanding in HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, MySql, and Node.JS.  I use Adobe Photoshop to create unique artwork and edit photos for my clients.  Adobe XD is my main framing and mockup platform.  As a code editor I use VS Code.
- 📫 How to reach me: you may email me at roy@roymsmith.com.

- 🔍 My goal is to join a team as a junior developer.  I seek to add value by leveraging my design, and programming skills, and by applying my 25 years of business experience.  As always, I am interested in any projects that continues my education, increases experience and that can benefit from my extensive 25 years as a successful entrepreneur. I use Adobe Photoshop to create unique artwork and edit photos.  Adobe XD is my main framing and mockup platform.  As a code editor I use VS Code.I am currently using UpWork to gain expereince as a web solutions provider focusing on the Node.JS environment, JS as a scripting language for both client-side and server-side, CSS for styling and of course HTML.  For database management I am profienct using MySQ.  I know my way around SQL but as always I am continually learning new ways to apply the domain specific language.
